					<description><![CDATA[Hey great advice, I agree that budgeting carefully and planning can help immensely when it comes to doing what you want.

I also think though that even for people who budget well, ultimately fear keeps them from taking risks. Being able to take risk is probably just as important as budgeting. 
Keep writing, this is good advice :)]]></description>
