					<description><![CDATA[Hey great advice, I agree that budgeting carefully and planning can help immensely when it comes to doing what you want.

I also think though that even for people who budget well, ultimately fear keeps them from taking risks. Being able to take risk is probably just as important as budgeting. 
Keep writing, this is good advice :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind words. I hope you enjoy the site.

The &#039;it is because it is&#039; mentality is quite interesting. Growing up in a traditional foreign-type household, I was surrounded by this way of thinking. We did things just because we had always done them that way. 

Some advice is good, some is bad. My grandma would cook with turmeric because her mom and her grandma and so on would cook with it - she had no idea why. Modern science has found it to have cancer inhibiting properties. It&#039;s as if people figured this out long ago and starting cooking with turmeric.

					<description><![CDATA[Just from reading this is making me motivated to change myself, as you did! Growing up, I was surrounded by &quot;do it because it is that way&quot; or &quot;this is what it is so believe it&quot; without even thought or question. It makes me wonder how do we break out of that and learn/start to question everything? Excited to see what future posts you&#039;ll have, and to see how you live life.]]></description>
